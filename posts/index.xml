      <description>Websites usually do not have a &amp;lsquo;how it was built&amp;rsquo; page.&#xA;But for this one, I felt compelled to have one. The content is of course mine, but I would not have been able to build this without many free tools, software and guidance. And I am convinced that when taking stuff from a community, one should also use best efforts to contribute. So here is my, very humble, contribution.</description>

Feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss further or require advice for your specific situation! &amp;ndash;&#xA;AIFMs, UCITS managers and asset managers/investment advisors are allowed to delegate certain functions under the AIFMD and its implementing laws.*1 The Belgian regulator FSMA has recently issued detailed guidelines on outsourcing, aimed specifically at AIFMs, UCITS and asset managers/investment advisors (hereafter referred to as ‘Companies’*2) - amidst a more general increased scrutiny vis-à-vis outsourcing arrangements by regulated entities.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Note: This post is a personal opinion/analysis and cannot be considered legal advice. Feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss further or require advice for your specific situation! &amp;ndash;&#xA;Over summer, ESMA updated its Q&amp;amp;A on the AIFM Directive (EU Directive 2011/61/EU) with some new questions (and more importantly, answers) - including with respect to pre-marketing in a context of sub-threshold managers (AIFMs).&#xA;Summary: ESMA confirmed that sub-threshold managers are not subject to the obligation to notify pre-marketing (unless otherwise required by national rules).</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Note: This post is a personal opinion/analysis and cannot be considered legal advice. Feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss further or require advice for your specific situation! &amp;ndash;&#xA;It is nowhere near as sexy as the recently voted MiCA package, or as crucial for the future of our planet as the CSDDD, but the European Commission last week also came up with a ‘Retail Investment Package’ (the &amp;ldquo;Package&amp;rdquo;) that is supposed to ‘empower retail investors’ and ‘make the EU an even safer place for people to invest their savings in the long term’ - which obviously are noble causes as well.</description>

Feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss further or require advice for your specific situation! &amp;ndash;&#xA;Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) the sub-threshold regime is largely left to national authorities.

      <description>&amp;ndash; Note: This post is a personal opinion/analysis and cannot be considered legal advice. Feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss further or require advice for your specific situation! &amp;ndash;&#xA;As ESMA points out itself at multiple instances, it was not involved in the case - neither as a regulator nor as a supervisor. As such, it could be expected that ESMA’s remarks would be well-measured, calling for further regulation on governance of crypto service providers and basically a ‘so this is why we need MiCA and/or further regulation’ (which indeed turned out to be the case).</description>
