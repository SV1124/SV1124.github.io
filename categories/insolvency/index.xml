      <description>&amp;ndash; Note: This post is a personal opinion/analysis and cannot be considered legal advice. Feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss further or require advice for your specific situation! &amp;ndash;&#xA;As ESMA points out itself at multiple instances, it was not involved in the case - neither as a regulator nor as a supervisor. As such, it could be expected that ESMA’s remarks would be well-measured, calling for further regulation on governance of crypto service providers and basically a ‘so this is why we need MiCA and/or further regulation’ (which indeed turned out to be the case).</description>
