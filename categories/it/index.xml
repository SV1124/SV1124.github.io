      <description>Here we are, a brand new blog. Some old content, some new content planned. After a year of using LinkedIn for blogging, I have decided I want to take it one step further and bundle some more stuff on here.&#xA;This has various reasons:&#xA;I get to keep better control over where my content ends up - if LinkedIn changes its business model, that&amp;rsquo;s not on me.&#xA;I do believe that a fragmented internet with easily accessible and searchable content is what the internet should be.</description>

      <description>Websites usually do not have a &amp;lsquo;how it was built&amp;rsquo; page.&#xA;But for this one, I felt compelled to have one. I would not have been able to build this without freely available tools, software and guidance. I am convinced that when taking stuff from a community, one should also use best efforts to contribute. Let this be my humble contribution.&#xA;Hope it may provide some inspiration or help to other people considering building their own blog or webpage and looking past the well-trodden CMS, Wix&amp;rsquo;es or Squarespaces of this world.</description>
