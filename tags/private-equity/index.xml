      <description>The final texts of AIFMD II were (finally) made available on the website of the council last autumn. Although not yet published in the official gazette, these final texts settle some points raised earlier.1 Full reviews of the final texts (and earlier) iterations are available elsewhere2 and many law firms have already issued newsletters providing overviews of the changes.
However, I found it useful to mold a short 5-question FAQ of some questions that came up most often in the run-up to AIFMD II.</description>
