      <title>A brief FAQ on AIFMD II</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/a-brief-faq-on-aifmd-ii/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final texts of AIFMD II were (finally) made available &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14932-2023-INIT/en/pdf&#34;&gt;on the website of the council&lt;/a&gt; last autumn. Although not yet published in the official gazette, these final texts settle some points raised earlier.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Full reviews of the final texts (and earlier) iterations are available elsewhere&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and many law firms have already issued newsletters providing overviews of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I found it useful to mold a short 5-question FAQ of some questions that came up most often in the run-up to AIFMD II.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AIFMs, UCITS managers and asset managers/investment advisors are allowed to delegate certain functions under the AIFMD and its implementing laws.*1 The Belgian regulator FSMA has recently issued &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fsma.be/en/news/outsourcing-handbook&#34;&gt;detailed guidelines on outsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, aimed specifically at AIFMs, UCITS and asset managers/investment advisors (hereafter referred to as ‘Companies’*2) - amidst a more general increased scrutiny vis-à-vis outsourcing arrangements by regulated entities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although not revolutionary, the guidelines provide significant extra body to applicable outsourcing requirements. They a.o. give further detail on the application of the proportionality principle to outsourcing and some general outsourcing principles (a.o. with regard to intra-group outsourcing). They also provide extensive guidance on the principles of sound management that must be taken into account when outsourcing. Consequently, existing outsourcing procedures and policies of (especially) licensed AIFMs, UCITs and asset managers/investment advisors might need a read-through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
