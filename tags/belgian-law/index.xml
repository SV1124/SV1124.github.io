      <description>AIFMs, UCITS managers and asset managers/investment advisors are allowed to delegate certain functions under the AIFMD and its implementing laws.*1 The Belgian regulator FSMA has recently issued detailed guidelines on outsourcing, aimed specifically at AIFMs, UCITS and asset managers/investment advisors (hereafter referred to as ‘Companies’*2) - amidst a more general increased scrutiny vis-à-vis outsourcing arrangements by regulated entities.
Although not revolutionary, the guidelines provide significant extra body to applicable outsourcing requirements.</description>

The regulation is based on three elements:
compliance with minimum rules to ensure that the information in the advertisement is correct and not misleading; the mandatory inclusion of specific warnings in the advertisement; and the obligation to notify the FSMA in advance of mass campaigns.</description>
