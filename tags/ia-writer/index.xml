      <description>&lt;p&gt;Websites usually do not have a &amp;lsquo;how it was built&amp;rsquo; page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for this one, I felt compelled to have one. I would not have been able to build this without freely available tools, software and guidance. I am convinced that when taking stuff from a community, one should also use best efforts to contribute. Let this be my humble contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope it may provide some inspiration or help to other people considering building their own blog or webpage and looking past the well-trodden CMS, Wix&amp;rsquo;es or Squarespaces of this world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
