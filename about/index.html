<p>I live near Antwerp, Belgium with my wife and 3 year old daughter - whom I both love to death.</p>
<p>I ride bikes and motorbikes, do some calisthenics and lifting every now and then, and love dancing (Salsa! Bachata!). I read way more useless stuff than is good for me, mainly blogs of all sorts. Also listen to some podcasts (see the synergies with the hours on the bike there?). Might do a separate post on what in my humble opinion is worth reading or listening to.</p>
<p>I have a weird fascination for keyboards (don&rsquo;t ask - or you will regret it) and my favourite piece of software is IA Writer.</p>
<h1 id="i-also-am-a-lawyer">I also am a lawyer.</h1>
<p>I am a managing associate at a boutique firm in Antwerp. I assist clients on matters related to financial law and regulation,  debt finance and restructuring.</p>
<p>This involves amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>assisting and advising on setting up finance packages or security packages and negotiating these (with lenders or borrowers!) - turns out that debt finance structuring and documentation can have a pretty significant impact</li>
<li>guiding clients through the maze of financial regulation to help them launch new products (in Belgium or Europe) or funds</li>
<li>assisting clients in monitoring and implementing new regulatory bodies (think AIFMD II, new loan origination frameworks, outsourcing rules, marketing rules, the new consumer credit directive, AML frameworks, DORA and ESG measures)</li>
<li>assisting clients who are in any capacity involved in restructurings</li>
<li>and so much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have a fond interest in all things <strong>Data privacy and security</strong>, <strong>crypto</strong>, <strong>digital services</strong>, <strong>virtual assets</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>. It is just fun to watch the future unfold before our eyes.</p>
<p>There are very few things I love to talk about more than my job (as do most lawyers, I guess).</p>
