<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit and interact with Steven’s Snippets (sv1124.github.io) (the &ldquo;<strong>Site</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I understand and value the importance of data privacy and have designed this Site to be respectful of your information and gather as little data or information on you as reasonably possible. I intend to stay true to this approach.</p>
<p>I may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changes in law, my practices, or the features of the Site. Amendments will be made available on this page. In case of material amendments, you will be informed by e-mail if you have shared an e-mail address with us (see below).</p>
<p>This policy was last amended on <strong>14 April 2024</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="collected-data">Collected data</h2>
<h3 id="which-data-are-collected">Which data are collected?</h3>
<h4 id="currently-none">Currently: none</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At this point, this Site does not collect or use any data or information from its users. This means that this Site does collect or use any cookies (neither for functionality, analytics, advertising or other purposes); any sensitive personal information; any information from third parties; any information with respect to your use of or time spent on this Site; or any information with respect to your IP address, name, location or other details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not intend to alter this approach in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="in-the-future-possibly-e-mail-addresses-if-you-share-it">In the future: possibly e-mail addresses, if you share it</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am considering offering an e-mail based subscription service (&ldquo;newsletter&rdquo;) to this blog, which will allow users to receive new posts on this blog directly as a newsletter by e-mail (the &ldquo;<strong>Subscription Service</strong>&rdquo;). If users would wish to use such Subscription Service, this would require users to share their e-mail address by explicitly filling out a form for such purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note in this respect that services like <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/">Firefox Relay</a> allow users to anonimize their e-mail address. I highly recommend this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-would-the-collected-data-be-used-for">What would the collected data be used for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the Subscription Service, including communication and notifications related to this Site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For security and fraud prevention, to comply with the law or, with your explicit consent, for other legitimate purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we believe it is necessary to protect your or my vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-would-the-collected-data-not-be-used-for">What would the collected data not be used for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing or selling data to any third parties (including partners, advertisers, service providers or law or other firms with whom I co-operate), except as set out below (&rsquo;<em>Would the collected data be shared with third parties?</em>&rsquo;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geolocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="would-the-collected-data-be-shared-with--third-parties">Would the collected data be shared with  third parties?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>E-mailaddresses will be shared with a third-party service provider used to distribute the newsletter related to the Subscription Service (such as Substack, Mailchimp, etc.). I will take great care in selecting a relevant service provider, and, once selected, will update this policy to provide more detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I may also share relevant e-mailaddresses with legal or regulatory authorities if required by law or regulation or if we believe it is necessary to protect your or my vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="would-the-collected-data-be-secure">Would the collected data be secure?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I use reasonable measures to safeguard your information against loss, theft and unauthorised access, use and modification - in particular by selecting an apt third party service provider (see previous paragraph).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, no electronic transmission or storage of data is 100% secure against hackers, cybercriminals or other unauthorised third parties. Hence, I strongly encouraging users to use relay e-mailaddresses like <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/">Firefox Relay</a> allow users to anonimize their e-mail address. I highly recommend this..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-long-would-the-collected-data-be-stored">How long would the collected data be stored?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As long as reasonably required to provide the Subscription Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will only retain it longer if necessary for legal purposes or for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm, investigate possible violatoins of law, or to protect myself, including my (intellectual property) rights, property or products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-rights-would-you-have-with-respect-to-your-data">What rights would you have with respect to your data?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will at all times retain access to; right to rectify; right to erase; right to restrict processing of and right to portability of your data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific details in this regard will be added should data in effect be gathered. Each e-mail will in any case provide in a possibility to unsubscribe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-of-third-party-services">Use of third party services</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This Site currently does not use any third party services that gather cookies or track your information. I do not intend to use cookies for analytics or commercial purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the future I might add <strong>&lsquo;share&rsquo; buttons</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, I might use a third party service to offer an <strong>e-mail based subscription service</strong> to posts on this Site (as set out above).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services used to enable the above may collect their own data in accordance with their own privacy policies. In both cases, I am actively looking to avoid or minimise such tracking and will clearly communicate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
